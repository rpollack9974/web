<H2>Tables of Iwasawa invariants of elliptic curves</H2>
<HR>
All computations have been done using MAGMA on William Stein's
modular cluster.
<hr>
There are still some bugs in the programs computing this
data -- so user beware!

On this website are tables of Iwasawa invariants of elliptic
curves (currently being computed).  Specifically, for each curve
(labeled as in Cremona) the mu and lambda-invariants are listed
for the primes between 2 and 13.  <p>
The data is formatted in 9 columns.
The first column records the curve's name.  The second column
records the rank.  The remaining seven columns are devoted to the 
primes 2,3,5,7,11, and 13.  In each column there are three numbers
<p>
 &nbsp mu &nbsp lambda &nbsp lambda<sub>MW</sub>
<p>
where lambda_MW is the Mordell-Weil part of the lambda invariant. <br>
-if the curve has supersingular reduction at p then the plus/minus
invariants are listed with the plus invariants on top of the minus 
invariants. <br>
-if the curve has split multiplicative reduction, a trivial
zero is expected and in such cases a "*" follows the three invariants. 
<br>
-if the curve has additive reduction at p then no invariants are
listed. <br>
-this program will not detect higher order zeroes of the L-function.
So both the rank and lambda<sub>MW</sub> should be
taken as lower bounds.  In particular rank 2 curves are listed as rank 1.

The following tables contain the Iwasawa invariants of quadratic twists
of curves of low conductor for p=2,3,5 and 7.  The format is similar
to the preceeding tables -- here the first column is the discriminant
of the twist.

The following table computes the lambda and mu invariants for
37A with p varying from 3 onward.  The format of the data is <p>

p &nbsp | &nbsp mu &nbsp lambda &nbsp lambda<sub>MW</sub>
<p>
-if the curve has supersingular reduction at p then 
the plus/minus invariants are listed side-by-side with the
plus invariants first.
