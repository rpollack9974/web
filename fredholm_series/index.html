<H3>Fredholm series for
U<sub>p</sub> (data and code)</H3>

We implement a formula for the characteristic series of U<sub>p</sub> acting on 
spaces of overconvergent cuspforms as a two-variable power series over the 
p-adic integers. We used this implementation to produce the examples in 
the paper "Arithmetic properties of Fredholm series for p-adic modular 
forms". A README is included describing those examples. Also included is a 
pre-computed sage object containing the first 20 (!) coefficients of the 
characteristic series U<sub>2</sub> acting in tame level one.

<H3>Ghost series</H3>

<b>Code</b>: The below SAGE code allows one to compute the ghost series, ghost 
slopes at all weights (even in characteristic p) and to draw 
pictures of the ghost spectral halo.  The top of the code contains a brief explanation of the main functions and how 
they are used.

<b>Code</b>: The below SAGE code allows one to compute with abstract ghost series and in particular 
with ghost series attached to a fixed mod p representation.  See the sample run for an explicit 
example.

<b>Ghost zeroes vs. true zeros</b>: The below pdf files give tables 
which compare the 
location of the true zeroes of coefficients of the Fredholm series of 
U<sub>p</sub> to that of the ghost zeroes.  From these tables one can 
see how strikely close the zeroes match.  Further, the multiplicity
pattern of the ghost zeroes is explained by this data.

Click <a href=slope_data/59slopes.txt>here</a> for a list of the slopes 
of the Hecke operator T<sub>59</sub> acting on cuspforms of level one, 
in even weights between 2 and 1640.

Compare with the data on Gouv&#234;a's page 
<a href=http://personal.colby.edu/personal/f/fqgouvea/slopes/exceptional.html>here</a>.

(The format for our file is (k,list) and list is another list containing pairs 
[a,m<sub>a</sub>] meaning the slope a appear m<sub>a</sub>-many times.)

<b>Code</b>: The below MAGMA code allows one to compute the slopes of forms with a fixed residual 
representation.  See the sample run for an explicit example.
