<H2>Guidelines </H2>
<ul>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<li>I require at least <b>3 weeks notice</b> for any letter of recommendation 
(but I prefer something more like 2 months advance notice).  The less 
notice I receive from you, the more likely it is that I will submit your 
letter late.
 <P>
<li>For student asking for letter of recommendation for graduate school or undergraduate transfer applications, I require a grade of:
<ul>
<li> A or A- for students in large (100 student) lecture classes
<li> B+ or higher for students in smaller classes
</ul>
unless you have a really good reason for me to waive this rule.  For students asking for letters for summer programs, I require a B or better.
<P>
<li>You must <b>waive your right</b> to see any letters I submit.  (My personal 
belief is that schools won't take my letter seriously if they know the 
student has access to it.)
<P>
<li>
As most applications are now electronic, I cannot upload my letter 
until you enter me as a reference into their system.  You should do this 
well before the deadline or risk me submitting your 
letter late.
<p>
<li>For electronic applications, be sure to use the e-mail address 
<b>rpollack@math.bu.edu</b> for my contact info.  Further, <b>fill out all 
parts of the online application</b>.  Information on the math 
department's address, my position's title, etc. are on my webpage.

</ul>

<H2>What you should submit to me</H2>
<ul>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<li>a list of all programs for which you need a letter along with <b>each 
separate deadline</b> listed
<P>
<li> any documents you have that might help me in 
writing a letter (e.g. a resume, an essay from your application, a 
transcript, etc.)
<P>
<li>a list of your other letter writers and their departments
<P>
<li> For paper applications, please include addressed envelopes (with postage) with my address listed as the return address.
Further, <b>fill out all parts of the form </b> (excluding my signature and date, of course).  Information on the math department's address, my 
position's title, etc. are on my webpage.  Lastly, if it is possible for you to send me an electronic form which I then fill out and print myself, I would prefer this.
</ul>
